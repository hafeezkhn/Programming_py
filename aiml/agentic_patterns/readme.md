Development Env
--> python
--> code editors(vscode)
--> openAI account api key or ollama setup

Agentic pattern
---------------

AutoGen: is opensource framework allow developers to building AI agent,
 
 ---------------                   -------------------
| openAI agent |--communicates-->|other agent(coding)|
 --------------                    -------------------

features of AutoGen
-------------------
--> enables building next-gen LLM applications easier we can build these applications basaed on multi-agent conversations
    simplifies:
     orchestration
     automation
     optimization of complex LLM workflows
     heightens LLLM model performonce
-->deverse workflow
    plug and play agents
    developers can use Autogen to build various types of converstaion patterns

-->providex collection of working systems already

Autogen Agent an entity that can send and recive message to from other agent 
eg:
   conversable agent 
   ->a list of LLMs 
   ->code executer
   ->function and tool executor
   ->component for keeping human-in-loop

design patterns:solve complex problem effeciently(proven solutions for common problems). helps reusable,maintanable ,and scalable
   Sw development is complicated : lot of moving parts like object creation,database layers ,userInterfaces
   hence,no need to reinvent the wheel :want tomstructure systems for object cration? use the Factory pattern
